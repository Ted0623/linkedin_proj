571,Data Analyst & Report Specialist (Remote),Heliolytics,"Toronto, ON",Remote,1 month ago,"Over the last two years, we’ve seen a massive increase in global demand for our services. As a team, we are working to set new standards on how to build and run solar energy sites at peak efficiency. As we continue to scale in 2022, we’re looking for more entry-level Data Analyst & Report Specialist’s to join our diverse remote-first team. This is a unique opportunity to start your career as an Analyst in the renewable energy industry.What We're Building:Roughly 70% of global power still comes from non-renewable polluting energy sources. As a climate-friendly and cost-effective energy solution, solar has the potential to drastically reduce our global CO2 emissions, helping to meet the World’s climate obligations for a clean energy transition. However, getting sites up and running is only the beginning. Once solar projects are built, many factors can interfere with performance. What we know from a recent industry report is that solar projects are underperforming by up to 6.3% on average. This number may seem inconsequential, but if these facilities continually perform shy of targets, this could interfere with private investment causing a ripple effect. Aligning financial risk and reward with low-carbon energy investments is critical for shifting the economy in the direction of reduced emissions. Without substantial private sector investment in clean energy, it will be more difficult, more costly, and more time-consuming to address climate change on a global scale.At Heliolytics, we’re working with our client partners to close that performance gap in order to enable a sustainable transition to clean energy and secure the future of our industry. We’re building a suite of industry-leading tools and services to enable our clients, which include some of the largest solar energy producers in the world, to maximize their energy output each year. Every marginal increase in efficiency is a huge win for our team, our client partners, and the environment. To date, our optimizations have resulted in increased energy production equivalent to 130,500 car-years of CO2 reductions.Our Analysis & Reporting Team:We manage our entire workflow in-house, from gathering imagery data using industry-leading tools and techniques to providing clear, actionable insights for clients to make the best decisions for their renewable energy assets. Our Analysis & Reporting Team plays an instrumental role in ensuring that the collected solar field data is processed correctly, and turned into clear, consistent deliverables for our clients.As an Analyst, You Will:Onboard client assets into our internal systemsAnalyze collected field imagery and resulting anomaly distribution, suggest potential issues and remediation for client assetsIdentify trends across client portfolios and ensure that these are communicated through our reportsReview data with our technical experts and write client reportsCreate other client deliverables using specialized software toolsComplete tasks related to our analysis workflow, such as database management, troubleshooting and consulting projectsAdditionally, you’ll gain insight into:The North American and global renewable energy industriesSolar (PV) system components, layouts, and maintenanceProcessing and presenting spatial datasetsWhat You Bring:An interest in aerial imagery interpretationA keen eye for detail and a commitment to high quality standardsExperience working on analysis-related projects (Internship & Academic experience considered)Experience working on projects with tight timelines, multiple stakeholders, or other complexities (Internship & Academic experience considered)Demonstrated ability to learn and adapt to new software technologies, and experience with broadly-used software packages (Adobe suite, Excel, Google suite, etc)A resourceful approach to problem solving A collaborative approach to communication and a genuine interest in the success and growth of the people you work withA passion for sustainability and an interest in renewable energyBonus Points:Imagery interpretation experience (satellite-based imagery analysis, or aerial photo interpretation)GIS software or packages or geospatial analysis (note: this is not a GIS technician position)Some experience with Python or programming languages (Analysts regularly interact with our Development team)Experience with scientific classification schemesWorking at HeliolyticsHeliolytics is a mosaic of talented people with different interests and goals united by our mission to build a sustainable transition to clean energy.
